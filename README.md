# rassh
  RASSH â€“ Reinforced Adaptive SSH Honeypot  This is a project developed for my Phd Thesis and the target is to create an Adaptive Honeypot capable of interacting with attackers using Reinforcement Learning.  The code is written in Python and it uses the Kippo SSH Honeypot as reference(source) to create an emulated SSH server that interacts with the attackers by allowing/blocking/delaying/substituting their commands or insulting them.  For the RL implementation the project uses PyBrain a modular Machine Learning Library for Python.
